# Gather data for one set of domains (github.com) to see what it looks like 
# I used this to work out that percentages total up to 100% when summing up all rows for an origin (devices) and the fast, avg, slow columns.

FROM `chrome-ux-report.materialized.device_summary` 
WHERE date = "2020-06-01" AND origin LIKE "%github.com%";
